----------------------------------------------------------------- Git Branch -----------------------------------------------------------------

# To create a new Branch: git branch <branch_name> 
# To check on which branch we are in, and checking new branch created or not: git branch
# To switch b/w the branched: git checkout <branch_name> 
  
{   To change from the current branch to different branch : git checkout new_branch_name
      Note : shortcut >> using -n option on checkout  will create a new branch, and move to it, if it does not exit
             eg : git checkout -b emergency_fix
      Note : After doing the code changes in the new branch we need to do all those add and commit in new branch
}
# Merging the current branch to master branch:
  Step1 : 1st switch to the master branch. i.e git checkout master
  Step2 : Now merge the current or master branch with the new_branch. i.e git merge <new_branch_name>
  Step3(optional) : Since the work for new branch is over we can delete that new branch. i.e git branch -d <new_branch_name>
